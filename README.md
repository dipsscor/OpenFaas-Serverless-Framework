# Micronaut:

Micronaut is a modern, JVM-based, full stack microservices framework designed for building modular, easily testable microservice applications.

Micronaut is developed by the creators of the Grails framework and takes inspiration from lessons learnt over the years building real-world applications from monoliths to microservices using Spring, Spring Boot and Grails.


Micronaut aims to avoid the downsides of frameworks like Spring, Spring Boot and Grails by providing:

    Fast startup time

    Reduced memory footprint

    Minimal use of reflection

    Minimal use of proxies

    Easy unit testing
